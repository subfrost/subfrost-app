The current task is to refactor the `subfrost-app` to match the `oyl.io` structure.
The build is failing with "Module not found" errors.
The next steps are to fix the "Module not found" errors.

Specifically, the following modules are not found:
- `../fonts/Satoshi-Light.woff2`
- `framer-motion`
- `@omnisat/lasereyes-react`
- `@oyl/api-provider`

### Staking Functionality
- ✅ Staking interface for frBTC/FROST
- ✅ Staking interface for BTC to dxBTC
- ✅ Staking interface for BTC to dxFROST (replacing Zap functionality)
- ✅ Unstaking interface with optimized layout (dxBTC on left, dxFROST on right)
- ✅ Clear information about unstaking outcomes for different assets
- ⚠️ Mock yield calculations (needs real data)

### Swapping Functionality
- ✅ Token swap interface
- ✅ LP interface
- ✅ Slippage settings
- ✅ Mock transaction table
- ⚠️ Mock price calculations (needs real AMM integration)

### Governance
- ✅ Basic proposal viewing
- ✅ Proposal creation interface
- ⚠️ Mock voting functionality (needs real implementation)

### Wallet Integration
- ✅ Wallet connection modal UI
- ✅ Basic wallet display
- ⚠️ Limited wallet connection functionality (needs full integration)

|---------|-----------|----------------------|----------|
| Wrapping | 90% | 40% | High |
| Staking | 85% | 30% | High |
| Swapping | 80% | 35% | Medium |
| Governance | 70% | 20% | Low |
| Wallet | 75% | 40% | Critical |

## Known Issues

### Technical Issues
1. **Mock Data Limitations**: Current mock implementations don't accurately represent blockchain behavior
2. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Some components need refinement for smaller screens
3. **Transaction Builder**: Needs implementation for real blockchain transactions
4. **Context Performance**: Some context providers may cause unnecessary re-renders
5. **Form Validation**: Incomplete validation for some input fields

### UX Issues
1. **Loading Feedback**: Insufficient feedback during blockchain operations
2. **Error Messages**: Generic error messages need to be more specific
3. **Help Text**: Missing explanatory text for complex operations
4. **Accessibility**: Some components need accessibility improvements
5. **Color Contrast**: Some text elements have insufficient contrast

### Known Bugs
1. **Balance Updates**: Balances don't always update after mock transactions
2. **Modal Closing**: Some modals don't properly reset state when closed
3. **Form Submission**: Double submission possible in some forms
4. **Chart Rendering**: Charts sometimes fail to render properly on initial load
5. **Navigation**: Active state sometimes incorrect after page refresh

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Architectural Changes
- **Initial Plan**: Use Redux for global state management
  - **Current Approach**: React Context API with custom hooks for simpler state management
  - **Reasoning**: Reduced complexity and bundle size, better integration with React's concurrent features

- **Initial Plan**: Use CSS Modules for styling
  - **Current Approach**: Tailwind CSS with custom utility classes
  - **Reasoning**: Faster development, consistent design system, better responsive design support

- **Initial Plan**: Build custom UI components from scratch
  - **Current Approach**: Use Shadcn UI with Radix primitives
  - **Reasoning**: Better accessibility, reduced development time, consistent behavior

### Feature Priority Shifts
- **Initial Focus**: Comprehensive governance system
  - **Current Focus**: Core wrapping and staking functionality
  - **Reasoning**: Establishing core value proposition before governance features

- **Initial Focus**: Multiple token support
  - **Current Focus**: BTC, frBTC, and FROST tokens only
  - **Reasoning**: Simplify initial implementation and user experience
  
- **Initial Focus**: Separate Zap functionality
  - **Current Focus**: Integrated BTC to dxFROST staking
  - **Reasoning**: Simplified user experience with clearer staking options

### Technical Implementation Changes
- **Initial Plan**: Use external APIs for blockchain data
  - **Current Approach**: Direct blockchain interaction
  - **Reasoning**: Reduced dependencies, better decentralization, more reliable data

- **Initial Plan**: Server-side transaction building
  - **Current Approach**: Client-side transaction building
  - **Reasoning**: Better security model, reduced server requirements

### Design Evolution
- **Initial Design**: Minimal, clean interface
  - **Current Design**: Distinctive frost/snowflake theme
  - **Reasoning**: Create stronger brand identity and memorable user experience

- **Initial Design**: Separate pages for each feature
  - **Current Design**: Card-based components with tabs
  - **Reasoning**: Better user flow between related features, reduced navigation

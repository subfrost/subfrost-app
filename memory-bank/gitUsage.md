# Git Usage Guidelines

## Important: Do Not Use Git Commands Unless Explicitly Requested

- **DO NOT** automatically use git commands (add, commit, push, etc.) after completing tasks
- **DO NOT** suggest using git commands unless the user specifically asks for version control assistance
- **ONLY** use git commands when the user explicitly requests to do so with instructions like "commit these changes" or "push to git"

## Appropriate Git Usage

Git commands should only be used when:
1. The user explicitly asks to commit or push changes
2. The user specifically mentions git in their request
3. Version control is a central part of the user's task

## Alternative Task Completion

When completing tasks:
1. Make the requested code changes
2. Explain what was changed
3. Do not suggest or execute git commands
4. Wait for further instructions from the user

Remember that most tasks can be completed without any git operations, and automatically using git after every prompt can be disruptive to the user's workflow.

# Product Context: Subfrost

## Why This Project Exists

Subfrost exists to bridge the gap between Bitcoin's store of value properties and the innovative DeFi functionalities available on other blockchains. Bitcoin, while being the largest and most secure cryptocurrency, has traditionally lacked the advanced financial capabilities that have driven growth in other blockchain ecosystems. Subfrost aims to solve this by bringing DeFi to Bitcoin holders without requiring them to move their assets to other chains.

## Problems Subfrost Solves

### 1. Limited Bitcoin Utility
Bitcoin is primarily used as a store of value or investment vehicle. Subfrost transforms BTC into a productive asset through wrapping, staking, and yield generation.

### 2. DeFi Accessibility for Bitcoin Holders
Many Bitcoin holders are hesitant to use other blockchains due to security concerns or technical barriers. Subfrost provides a Bitcoin-native DeFi experience that feels familiar and secure.

### 3. Yield Generation for Bitcoin
Bitcoin itself doesn't generate yield. Through Subfrost's wrapping and staking mechanisms, users can earn yield on their Bitcoin holdings while maintaining exposure to BTC.

### 4. Fragmented Bitcoin DeFi Landscape
The Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem is fragmented and often requires complex technical knowledge. Subfrost unifies various DeFi functions in one intuitive platform.

### 5. Governance Participation
Bitcoin lacks native governance mechanisms. Subfrost introduces a governance system that allows community members to participate in protocol decisions.

## How Subfrost Should Work

### Wrapping Mechanism
1. Users connect their Bitcoin wallet to Subfrost
2. They specify the amount of BTC they want to wrap
3. The system securely locks their BTC and mints an equivalent amount of frBTC (minus fees)
4. Users can unwrap their frBTC back to BTC at any time

### Swapping System
1. Users select the tokens they want to swap (e.g., frBTC to FROST)
2. They specify the amount and acceptable slippage
3. The system executes the swap using liquidity pools
4. Transaction history is recorded and displayed to the user

### Staking Process
1. Users choose which assets to stake (frBTC/FROST or BTC)
2. They specify the amount to stake
3. The system locks their assets and begins generating yield (dxFROST or dxBTC)
4. Users can unstake their assets at any time, receiving their original assets plus yield

### Governance Participation
1. FROST token holders can create governance proposals
2. Community members vote on proposals using their FROST tokens
3. Approved proposals are implemented by the protocol
4. Voting history and proposal status are transparently displayed
